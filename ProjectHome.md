# Welcome to the Code Incubator #

As developers we often find ourselves writing small one-off pieces of code for use as samples, experiments, prototyping, handy utilities, or any number of off-the-wall-ideas. As it's usually considered throw-away code we end up abandoning it shortly after we're done using it.

## But why? ##

Typically because we don't consider the code to be worth the effort of starting a new OSS project just to keep track of it. Well no longer!

## A home for all code ##

The Code Incubator servers as a repository for all of those throw-away bits we churn out. We keep them here so that other may find them, use them, and maybe even **learn** a little something from them.

Enjoy!
